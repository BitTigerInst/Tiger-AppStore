# BitTigerX-AppStore with Java (4th Session Team 9) 太阁X项目四期9组-AppStore项目

## Description
Create a simple app store web application. For your stack we suggest using the Spring-MVC framework along with: Hibernate ORM as an intermediary between Java and MySQL, MySQL for data storage, Tomcat 8.0 for your web server, and Angular JS for the front end. We suggest using the spring framework throughout the whole back-end. 

## Plan

### Todo List
- [x] Team meeting and self introduction
- [x] Write the proposal for the project
- [ ] Set up running environment and learn related frameworks (spring etc.)
- [ ] Create a web project and code web service
- [ ] Design front-end layout with AngularJS and Bootstrap
- [ ] Write the report for the project
- [ ] (Optional) Use MongoDB directly instead of MySQL
- [ ] (Optional) Enlarge the scope of the project: user management, category of apps and comments
- [ ] (Optional) Realize a single page with AngularJS

### Time Schedule
We divide our project into five phases: Phase 0, we learn the basic knowledge of web-development, including spring-mvc, spring and hibernate; Phase 1, we implement the most back-end functions of our AppStore; Phase 2, we design the front-end web page layout; Phase 3, we choose some optional functions to integrate into our AppStore; Phase 4, we summarize our project and finish the report of AppStore.
